            <main>

                <p>Born in 2000 in the Egyptian city of Fayoum, only two hours from the heart of Cairo’s bustling music industry, Zaza first ventured into music in his early teens. Like most Egyptians, he was captivated by the explosive mahraganat sound and its superstars, Sadat and Alaa 50, two artists he admired in his formative years. He tried to make and record mahraganat himself at 12 years old. Still, admittedly, he was too young and lacked the vision to take things beyond mere experimentation</p>

                <p>Fast forward to 2019 and the rise of Egyptian trap music. Zaza found himself fired up again after seeing people who resembled him in every way starting to weave themselves into Egyptian pop culture — people from outside Cairo just like him, people with similar means and backgrounds that worked more against than for them. During that period, rappers like Abyusif, Wegz, and Marwan Pablo transitioned from underground rappers on SoundCloud to trending YouTube phenomena, from small bedroom studios to big stages across the country and beyond.</p>

                <p>“At that point, I had spent a few years busy with life, working in clothes and stuff,” recalls Zaza. “I was still listening to music, though. I couldn’t go anywhere without my music. I kept up with what was new, and kept tabs on what I felt was missing until I could make music again. That’s when I started seeing people who looked just like me, doing exactly what I wanted to do. I was a huge trap supporter and listener.”</p>
                
                <p>By late 2018, Zaza was already back in the studio, this time trying his hand at trap. Even though he had developed as a person and listener since his attempts six years prior, he still hadn’t found the touch that would set him apart. “I was just like any other rapper. I was average,” he admits. “I still hadn’t found my path, sound, or topics. I didn’t know what made me good or bad, just like anyone else or different from anyone else.”</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "They have yet to see 1%. The circumstances are still against me." - <cite> Ziad Zaza</cite>      
               </blockquote>
            
                <p>This line is from Ziad Zaza‘s 2022 breakout hit, “Karreta Sarrefa”. If we all had a dollar for every time we heard a young rapper belt out something like that on a track, we’d all be Jay-Z rich. But, if you look at that line in the context of everything Zaza has achieved, getting a big-picture view of his career’s trajectory from the moment he recorded that track in a small Fayoum studio to all the accolades he has raked in since, you’d be pretty confident that Zaza can see into the future.</p>
